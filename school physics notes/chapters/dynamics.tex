\subsection{Newton's Laws of Motion}
\begin{definition}
    \begin{enumerate} The following are Newton's 3 laws:
        \item A body \textbf{stays ar rest} or \textbf{continues to move with a constant speed} in a \emph{straight} line unless acted upon by a \textbf{net} external force. 
        \item The \textbf{rate of change of linear momentum} of a body is \textbf{directly proportional} to the \textbf{resultant force} acting on it and is in the direction of the resultant force.
        \item 
    \end{enumerate}
